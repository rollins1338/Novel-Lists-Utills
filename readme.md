📚 Repository Index

This section catalogs all the translated Korean novels currently available in this repository. Most of them have the same genre (Dark Romance). Its my favorite genre so yea I'm hella biased. I rate all these novels 4 ⭐ or 5. They're all really good trust me.

So here's the list -

*(Ongoing ones could be originally completed but I haven't finished adding them to the repo)*
